## 🔥 Pro Tips

### For Streamers
1. **Test First**: Try all actions in practice mode before going live
2. **Set Cooldowns**: Use thresholds to prevent spam (e.g., 5 gifts = 1 action)
3. **Balance Chaos**: Mix helpful and chaotic actions
4. **Explain to Viewers**: Tell them which gifts do what
5. **Watch the Activity Log**: Monitor what's triggering in real-time

### For Testing
1. **Start Small**: Test basic actions (power-ups, coins) first
2. **Watch Timers**: Physics chaos actions have durations (check console)
3. **Level Matters**: Some actions work better in certain levels
4. **Sprite Limit**: Only 12 enemies can exist at once (hardware limit)
5. **Pause Safe**: Game must be unpaused for actions to take effect

### Troubleshooting in 10 Seconds
- **Actions not working?** → Check SNI is running + RetroArch network ON
- **Gifts not triggering?** → Verify TikTok username + "Start Polling" ON
- **SNI won't connect?** → Restart RetroArch with SMW loaded, then restart SNI

## 🎨 Popular Streaming Setups

### Setup 1: Chaos Mode
- Every gift triggers an action
- No cooldowns
- Pure chaos, maximum viewer engagement
- **Warning**: Very difficult gameplay!

### Setup 2: Threshold Mode
- Individual gifts do nothing
- Thresholds trigger big actions
- Example: "20 roses = Boss spawn!"
- Encourages coordinated viewer effort

### Setup 3: Balanced Mode
- Common gifts = helpful actions (mushroom, coins, lives)
- Rare gifts = chaos (physics mods, enemy waves)
- Thresholds = mega events (warp to Bowser, boss fights)
- Best for longer streams

### Setup 4: Speedrun Sabotage
- Speedrunner tries to finish game
- Viewers sabotage with enemy spawns and physics chaos
- Race against time and chaos!

## 📊 Recommended Action Durations

Based on testing:

- **Physics Mods**: 20-30 seconds (gives viewers time to see chaos)
- **Enemy Waves**: 30-60 seconds (longer = more enemies)
- **Star Power**: 20-30 seconds (invincibility should be limited)
- **Reverse Controls**: 15-20 seconds (very disorienting)
- **Ice Physics**: 30-45 seconds (fun but not too punishing)

---

## 🚀 What to Do Next

1. ✅ **Test Actions**: Go through Full Controls, try every button
2. ✅ **Map Gifts**: Assign your top 10 TikTok gifts to actions
3. ✅ **Set Thresholds**: Create 3-5 threshold triggers for big events
4. ✅ **Practice Stream**: Test with a private stream first
